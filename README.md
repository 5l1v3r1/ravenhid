Hardware and software to run a RFID reader to harvest card information.  This is still a work in progress. It will eventually be a board that runs a RFID reader off a Lithium Polymer battery.  A larger reader, such as those in garages, will be used for long range reading.  The board design will support multiple methods of getting the harvested information: 
- Text file on a MicroSD card
- Print out to LCD
- Bluetooth Low Energy Arduino serial connection 

These options will all be pluggable on the PCB and documented in code to allow users to only use those items that are necessary for their setup.
